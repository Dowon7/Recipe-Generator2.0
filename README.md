# Recipe-Generator

Ingridio is a group project where we were tasked with API integration into a webpage.

We were able to make this project happen with the usage of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
Complemented with AJAX and MD Bootstrap.

We wanted to create a practical application that is usable in everyday life, and help ease a daily challenge that many of us might have - what to eat.
We tried for a different approach, rather than having a wheel dictate what to have as your next meal, we wanted users to be able to make a decision on what to cook, given the ingredients they may have lying on hand in the pantry or fridge.

Using two APIs form Spoonacular, and the Cocktail database, users can input what ingredients they have or would like to use, to find an assortment of recipes for them to choose.
The APIs would then allow us to display an image linked with the recipe, and the abilty for the users to go to the respective website to see the full recipes.

If the recipes for the food and cocktails are not to your liking, you can use the "show more" button to see more selections of recipes available.

Some things about the webpage:

*The First Recipe card should be the last recipe selected from your previous sessions

*Then Second and Third recipe card should be a snack and main course recipe respectively
